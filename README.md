## How to Run the application locally
There are two folders 

    1) RestApi -> Backend
    
    2) RestApi-ui -> Frontend
    
To Run the Web App on your system you need to make sure that your system must contain

    1) Node Js Installed with npm (Node Package Manager) working on it
    
        -> To Check If it is working
        
        Type
        
            -> node --version
            
            it will return the version of node
            
            -> npm --version
            
            it will return the version of your node package manager (npm)
            
    2) Mongodb Installed
